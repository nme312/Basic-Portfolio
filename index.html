                I was always interested in making programs, particularly video games, but I was first introduced to coding when I took a
                computer science class in high school. There I learned a little Javascript and even made a few programs, e.g:
                a database capable of storing differnt values in an array as well as altering and retrieving the data found in
                it, simple games using a system of if-else statements like Rock, Paper, Scissors, a trivia game using text recognition, etc.

                I am currently enrolled in NU Coding Bootcamp. I am hoping to compound upon the skills that I already have
                to use them to make myself more competitive in the industry, and simply because I really love and enjoy coding.
                I enjoy being challenged, sometimes only after I've conquered the obstacle in my way. I am always ready to learn
                something new and have no problem with not being the smartest person in the room
